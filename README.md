# Prime Now Orders

The aim of this tool is to help creation of (repeated) orders on (Amazon) Prime Now.

Main premise is being that households have more or less the same shopping list that they buy periodically.

Prime Now interface does not allow users to 'bulk import / copy' shopping list and add / remove items. It forces users
to search for every single item and add them to the cart.

This tools uses your "Order History" and allows you to copy multiple previous orders into your cart.

From there using Prime Now app you are able to remove / add items and checkout.


Notes:
- Prime Now allows maximum 50 unique items in your cart
- Orders that are currently out of stock will not be added to your cart (when you run the script)


## How to use this script
